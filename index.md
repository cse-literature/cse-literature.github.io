A inclusive and open place for everyone interested in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE): from practicioners over newbies and students to professional researchers.

## CSE-literature
The goal is to gather interesting resources on CSE, bundled around specific topics (no matter the format, from academic paper over blogpost to podcast). From mathematical analysis, over numerical implementation, to societal relevance and industrial applications. 

## CSE-discussion
We plan to apply for a [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) channel, in order to stimulate discussion.
